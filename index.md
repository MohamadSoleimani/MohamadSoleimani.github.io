### Hi, I'm Mohammad 👋

***“It is possible for ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary.”*** *(Elon Musk)*


As a computational student passionate about applying my programming skills to various areas of engineering, there’s nothing more rewarding to me than completing my work with a touch of creativity. With a strong focus on computational methods, I’ve immersed myself in projects that leverage open-source software like FEniCS to solve complex mechanical problems. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) also fascinate me, and I’ve led several projects using these cutting-edge techniques. These experiences have significantly deepened my understanding of how computational tools can enhance mechanical and biomedical engineering. Additionally, I've worked on exciting projects, including the separation of CTCs from blood using microfluidic chips and the development of Iran’s first multi-channel real-time PCR system. If you scroll down, you’ll discover more about these projects and how I’ve integrated my computational expertise to solve diverse engineering challenges!
