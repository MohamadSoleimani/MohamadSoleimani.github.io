### Hi, I'm Mohammad 👋

***“It is possible for ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary.”*** *(Elon Musk)*

There’s nothing more rewarding to me than completing my work with a touch of creativity. As a graduate mechanical engineer with a passion for the intersection of programming and mechanical engineering, I’ve immersed myself in projects that leverage open-source software like FEniCS to solve complex mechanical problems. Additionally, I find Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) fascinating, leading several projects in this area. These experiences have significantly deepened my understanding of the field. If you scroll down, you’ll discover some of the exciting projects I’ve been a part of!
